# portfolio

Containers a description of me as well as an overview of my projects. You can also follow my progress in new code languages and skills. Later on I will share my thoughts on different areas around code and development.

Hope you like it!

I had some issues with the profile img to find the right measurements to get it look good in my header. But eventually it turned out alright.
